With the recent announcement of plans by the world 's major naval powers to build new frigates , it seems that the frigate has become the focus of the naval attention of the major powers overnight .

With the launch of the latest Type 054A frigate at the end of 2017 , it marks the construction of as many as 29 of the 54A frigates , approaching the total of the 053H series of frigates , and since the launch of the first 054A in 2006 , the 54A has been built for 12 years , even around the world , with the number of such high - performance frigates built in the United States , with the exception of Perry in the 1980s .
And the reason for the construction of so many 054A is simple , that is affordable , easy to use , plus years of naval arrears .
054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese navy for many years because of its high cost - effective and good combat effectiveness . Its 4000 - ton displacement , carrying a 76 - millimetre main gun , 32 - unit sea red flag - 16 and fish - 8 anti - submarine missile launching system , 8 eagles strike 83 and a straight - 9 helicopter , although it was built in 2006 , and the design time of the ship is very early in the world .
First of all , there will be a significant increase in displacement relative to the current model 054A frigate . It is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5,000 - 6,000 tons . The power system will adopt an integrated power propulsion system consisting of a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines , with a maximum speed expected to reach about 30 knots and a substantial increase in endurance ; As for the weapon configuration 76 mm main gun and 1130 near anti - aircraft gun should be retained , but a red flag 10 launch system will be added . Behind the main gun there should be a 32 - 48 unit red flag 16 modified and fish - 8 common vertical hair system , which should be installed in the rear of the hull with an 8 - 16 unit large vertical hair system for the launch of eagles and new cruise missiles ; and if the main gun is equipped with a low - level radar system , it should also be used for the development of two - level radar systems .
As a result , the overall level of the new frigate will reach the top level in the world , even when compared with the FFG in the US .
